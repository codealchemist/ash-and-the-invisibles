Rock And Roll Queen

--( VERSE )---------------------------
My rock 'n' roll queen,  
She's the real deal,  
Dancing like a hurricane,  
She makes me feel,  
Alive and wild,  
Heartbeat on a suntan,  
She's the one I want,  
The angel of my dreams

--( BRIDGE )--------------------------
She's so wild  
She's a real rolling stone

--( VERSE )---------------------------
You are  
My dancing queen  
You are  
Just the real deal  
Hey, sexy  
You make me feel  
Crazy as I was in my teenage years.

Her leather jacket and her  
Worn-out jeans,  
She's a rebel lady  
In the midnight scenes,  
In the city lights,  
Stands nice alone,  
My heart's on fire,  
I just can't let go.

--( BRIDGE )--------------------------
Riding the highway,  
Never looking back,  
Together we'll conquer,  
There's no need to pack,

--( CHORUS )--------------------------
Oh Baby  
You just drive me crazy  
All I wanna do,  
Is to wake up
In my bedroom with you

And babe  
Your smile every day,  
Sets my heart on fire  
I'm falling for your groove  
With you  
I just got nothing to prove  
Got nothing to pro-o-ove

--( SOLO )----------------------------

--( CHORUS )--------------------------
Oh Baby  
You just drive me crazy  
All I wanna do,  
Is to wake up  
In my bedroom with you

And babe  
Your smile every day,  
Sets my heart on fire  
I'm falling for your groove  
With you  
I just got nothing to prove  
Got nothing to pro-o-ove
