Through The Ages

--( VERSE )---------------------------
This soul that rises here,  
Elsewhere is but dusk,  
I once said goodbye,  
To these same candid eyes.  
Over and over again,  
Everything starts and ends,  
I wonder what else is constant,  
Maybe it's just my wonder.
As tides that come and go,  
Our souls reunite again.

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
Feels,  
There's something more to why we are here,  
Fate weaves our path,  
Along with our brothers,  
Seems,  
That birth is but sleep,  
Won't be afraid,  
Life's more than survival
Voices of the past ride the winds  
It's the ancestral call  

--( VERSE )---------------------------
Hey don't worry love,  
What's meant to be shall always find its way,  
We endured hardship before,  
Like then we'll rise once more,  
Through the ages the echoes throng,  
You're always standing by my side,  
We got dreams, a newborn baby,  
And wings to aim for the sun,  
We learned to pick the rose by its thorns,  
Tasting beauty with pain.

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
Feels,  
There's something more to why we are here,  
Fate weaves our paths,  
Along with our brothers',  
Seems,  
That birth is but sleep,  
Won't be afraid,  
Life's more than survival,  
Voices from the past ride the winds,  
Aching to unfold,  
In our hearts once more.
