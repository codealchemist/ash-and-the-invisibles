My Last Stand

--( VERSE )---------------------------
Long ago, I freed my soul,  
Letting it decide  
What to do, where to go  
To me it was just right

I'm a loner,  
Since I can recall,  
I'm an old man,  
Outer wrinkles inner scars
But I'm home,  
Wherever I go,  
I feel strong  
Walking in the storm

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
Please, heart don't let me down, now  
Give me one more ride,  
Golden days, never last,
And please...

Aid me in my last stand  
After the things we've done,  
May the wind,  
Pull us to the other bank

--( VERSE )---------------------------
Journeying through the world  
Never looking back  
Countless faces, countless towns
Keeping baggage light,  
I'm a stranger  
Everywhere I go  
Seeking solace
In the warmth of a passing love
But I know,  
It's a sterile road  
No regrets though  
As I drift away

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
Please, heart don't let me down, now  
Give me one more ride,  
Golden days, never last,
And please...

Aid me in my last stand  
After the things we've done,  
May the wind,  
Pull us to the other bank
