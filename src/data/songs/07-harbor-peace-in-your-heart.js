Harbor Peace In Your Heart

--( VERSE )----------------------------
Hey if you want to get far  
Just give love  
Don't be shy  
And give in to affection.  
So, you think  
Now is the time  
I say you better start  
Since you have expiration.

And wise is the simple person  
Who has few possessions  
Purposely to be free,  
From nature get inspiration,  
We're a piece of creation  
Harbor peace in your heart.

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
Oh harbor peace in your heart!  
Oh harbor peace in your heart!

--( VERSE )----------------------------
You're looking for purpose in life,  
You will find as you try,  
Life is worth to be lived,  
And never stop asking why  
Don't look into the eyes  
Of who hates the big questions.

Stop your procrastination,  
The worst mutilation  
Is ignoring your heart,  
There's no predestination,  
Love without hesitation  
You've got your free will.

--( RAP-VERSE )------------------------
Walking on the streets  
I find out that people  
Don't react,  
Just give in to their fears,  
I don't see lovers kiss  
Or hold hands,  
No one looks into my eyes.  
As everybody else I survived  
Without knowing how to live,  
I was moved deep inside  
By the touch of my child  
And her smile,  
She taught me how to fly.

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
Oh, hug the people you love,  
Oh, hug the people you love.
