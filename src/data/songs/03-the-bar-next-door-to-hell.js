The Bar Next Door To Hell

--( INTRO )---------------------------
Living is a thorny affair  
You're greeted with a blow  
Many more pave your way to heaven  
If only grace your heart is seeking  
It'll break  
Don't insist on that thinking  
Or you're to blame

--( VERSE )---------------------------
Living comes at a cost  
You can't reject the deal  
Tough love  
Is the world's way of teaching  
Wise men really know  
How to take a beating  
Reading pains is not in vain  
'Cos words are lousy teachers

--( BRIDGE )---------------------------
If only truth your heart is seeking  
It'll fail  
Black or white  
Are just delusion  
All things are grey

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
I'll be fine  
Drinking wine  
At the bar next door to hell  
Over time  
Every man must stop by  
To meet the devil

--( BRIDGE )---------------------------
Any place  
Is bad as any  
For your grave  
The only wealth  
You're ever given  
Is your own death

--( VERSE )----------------------------
You may know  
What's your soul  
When you bind together  
All your evil and the good  
Confronting your demons

Every high and every low  
Are part of this great puzzle  
Don't blame God  
For your fate  
Good luck don't make you stronger

--( BRIDGE )---------------------------
Drop all hopes  
Of finding a meaning  
And resentment fades  
Loss and gain  
Same affliction  
Just heads and tails

--( SOLO )-----------------------------

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
I'll be fine  
Drinking wine  
At the bar next door to heaven  
Over time  
Every man must stop by  
To meet an angel

--( OUTRO )----------------------------
When time's up  
I can be found  
Getting drunk with my fellows  
See you soon  
At the bar  
That reunites  
Saints, men and demons
