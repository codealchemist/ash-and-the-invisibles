The Gates To The End

--( VERSE )---------------------------
Stillness in the night I sense a storm,  
And it's within I'm better on my own, now  
Life's like a riddle,  
The past haunts me in my head  
Oblivion killed my aim,  
What's left was buried by pain,  
Waiting for the turn of the tide  
Alone, I became a quiet soul.

Foolishly wrestling with my fate,  
I wasted all my time, it's almost late, now  
It's hard to let go,  
But I learned it's the way to grow,  
I quit searching for truth,  
My breath is all I've got,  
Drifting in the unknown with no regrets,  
Dreaming that I'm awake.

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
Hey it's ok,  
If these are the gates of the end,  
Cos I'm done being afraid,
Of the night getting closer every day,  
I am strong on my own,  
Never again going ashore,  
Sailing straight, into the storm,  
Feeling how strong the wind blows  
Gazing at my fears,  
Got some glimpses of myself.

--( VERSE )---------------------------
Grief is the price I paid for love,  
And it's a force beyond human control  
Life is like a river,  
The past awaits me at the end,  
Stripped of all my thoughts  
I'm trying to know myself  
Drifting in the unknown in sweet silence,  
Dreaming that I'm awake.

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
Hey, it's ok,  
If these are the gates of the end,  
Cos I'm done being afraid,  
Of the night getting closer every day,  
Freedom's bliss,  
Fear is death,  
Stop shutting down all your dreams,  
Ride with me,  
To the end,  
Let's keep going to the edge of the cliff,  
Kiss and open our wings!

--( SOLO )-----------------------------

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
Hey, it's ok,  
Once you learn death is part of the dream,  
Letting go of self control,  
In surrender I welcome the now,  
Free and whole is my soul,  
Quitting the yearning for more,  
Getting close to the source,  
I see how the illusion was born.  
Gazing at the abyss,  
Got some glimpses of myself.
