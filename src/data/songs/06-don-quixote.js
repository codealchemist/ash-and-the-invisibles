Don Quixote

--( VERSE )----------------------------
Following his vision  
Rides the knight-errant,  
With his soul,  
Yearning for adventure.  

Honor comes with bruises,  
Glory in the fight,  
Knew how pain,  
Makes the spirit stronger.

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
Saw the world as it should be,  
Reality is too somber,  
Searching for a virtuous past  
Of chivalry and courage.

--( VERSE )----------------------------
Even in the darkness,  
He would see the light,  
And the good,  
In each and every person.

Lived up to his word,  
Was Quixote's aim,  
Freeing himself,  
From the spell of comfort.

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
Sought a world as it should be,  
Reality is too somber,  
His ideals set him free,  
Filling his life with purpose.

--( SOLO )-----------------------------

--( CHORUS )---------------------------
Sought a world with no greed,  
Evil or deception,  
From delusion grew his wings,  
To reach the gates of heaven.
